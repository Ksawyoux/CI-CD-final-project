# Test Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the results of the functional test execution conducted on the application's core functionalities. The primary objective was to verify the stability and correctness of key features, including user authentication and mission management.

Out of 2 critical test cases executed, 1 passed successfully, while 1 experienced a critical failure. The "Add New Mission" test case failed due to an underlying `chromedriver` issue, indicating a potential problem with element interaction or the application's responsiveness during the mission creation process. This failure significantly impacts a core business function and requires immediate attention.

### Test Case: Add New Mission

*   **Test Case ID:** TC-002 (Assumed)
*   **Status:** FAILED
*   **Description:** The test case designed to verify the functionality of adding a new mission to the system failed to complete successfully. This indicates that users are currently unable to create new missions through the automated flow.
*   **Failure Message:** While no specific error message was provided beyond "FAILED", the presence of a detailed `chromedriver` stacktrace indicates a low-level issue during the automated interaction with the browser.
*   **Stacktrace:**

    ```
*   **Probable Cause (Hypothesis):** The stacktrace indicates a crash or unhandled error originating from `chromedriver` during a command execution. This points to an issue with how the automation script interacts with the Chrome browser. Potential causes include:
    *   **Element Unavailability/Staleness:** The script attempted to interact with an element that was not yet present, not visible, or had become stale (e.g., after a DOM refresh).
    *   **Locator Issues:** An incorrect or unstable element locator causing the driver to fail when trying to find or interact with an element required for mission creation.
    *   **Browser/Driver Mismatch:** An incompatibility between the installed Chrome browser version and the `chromedriver` version used for testing.
    *   **Application Instability:** The application under test (AUT) might be experiencing a bug or crash during the "Add New Mission" workflow, leading the `chromedriver` to encounter an unexpected state.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical functional failure. The inability to add new missions directly impacts core business operations and data entry. This could lead to a complete blocker for specific user roles or workflows.

## 6. Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Investigation:** Prioritize the debugging and investigation of the "Add New Mission" test case. This is a high-severity issue.
2.  **Automation Script Review:**
    *   Thoroughly examine the automation script steps for `Add New Mission`.
    *   Verify the accuracy and stability of all element locators used throughout the mission creation flow.
    *   Ensure the implementation of appropriate explicit waits (`WebDriverWait` with `ExpectedConditions`) to handle dynamic element loading and ensure elements are ready for interaction.
    *   Add additional logging and screenshot captures at each step to pinpoint the exact point of failure.
3.  **Manual Verification:** Attempt to manually add a new mission in the test environment. If the issue is reproducible manually, it indicates an application defect that needs to be escalated to the development team. If it works manually, the issue lies within the automation script or environment configuration.
4.  **Environment and Version Check:**
    *   Confirm that the installed Chrome browser version is compatible with the `chromedriver` version being used. Update either if a mismatch is found.
    *   Verify the stability of the test environment and check for any recent deployments or changes that might have introduced regressions.
5.  **Defect Logging:** Based on the investigation, if an application bug is confirmed, log a high-priority bug ticket with detailed steps to reproduce, actual vs. expected results, and the full stacktrace.
6.  **Developer Collaboration:** Proactively communicate with the development team to share findings and collaborate on a swift resolution.

## 7. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Action (Today):**
    *   Initiate a manual test of the "Add New Mission" functionality on the staging environment.
    *   Begin debugging the automated "Add New Mission" test script, focusing on element interactions and explicit waits.
    *   Log a critical defect (if confirmed to be an AUT issue) or an automation bug ticket (if confirmed to be a script issue).
*   **Post-Resolution:**
    *   Re-execute the "Add New Mission" test case immediately after any fix or script update is deployed.
    *   If the test passes, perform a targeted regression test on related mission management functionalities to ensure no new defects were introduced.
    *   Update test documentation and status reports to reflect the resolution.
