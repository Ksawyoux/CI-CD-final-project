# Test Report: Core Application Functionality

**Date Generated:** 2025-07-09 10:07:11
**Tested Version:** Not specified (Assuming latest development build)
**Test Environment:** Chrome 138.0.7204.93 on macOS (Inferred from stacktrace)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings from the recent execution of core application functionality tests. A total of 2 test cases were executed, covering critical features such as user authentication and mission management.

The test run yielded a **50% pass rate**, with 1 test case passing and 1 test case failing. The primary concern is the **failure of the "Add New Mission" functionality**, which encountered an `ElementClickInterceptedException`. This indicates a significant issue where a UI element is obstructing a critical interaction, potentially hindering user workflows. Immediate investigation and resolution are recommended to ensure the application's core features are functional and user-friendly.

## 5. Failed Tests Analysis

### Test Case: Add New Mission

*   **Status:** FAILED
*   **Error Type:** `ElementClickInterceptedException` (Selenium WebDriver)
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    element click intercepted: Element <button type="button" class="chakra-button mui-1ynj8wc">...</button> is not clickable at point (1068, 20). Other element would receive the click: <svg viewBox="0 0 128 128" class="chakra-avatar__svg mui-16ite8i" role="img" aria-label=" avatar">...</svg>
    ```
*   **Observed Behavior:** The automated test script attempted to click a button for adding a new mission. However, the click action was intercepted by another element, specifically an SVG avatar component, which was positioned over the target button at the time of the click. This prevented the "Add New Mission" functionality from being initiated.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The "Add New Mission" button should be clearly visible and clickable, allowing the user (or automated script) to proceed with the mission creation workflow without interference from other UI elements.
*   **Root Cause Hypothesis:**
    1.  **UI Overlap/Z-index Issue:** The `<svg>` avatar element is rendering on top of the target `<button>` element due to CSS styling, z-index conflicts, or responsive layout issues at the specific resolution/browser window size.
    2.  **Timing/Asynchronous Rendering:** The avatar element might be appearing dynamically (e.g., after a short delay, or upon an event) and is not fully settled or dismissed before the test attempts to click the button.
    3.  **Layout Instability:** The page layout may be shifting slightly after initial load, causing the overlap, which is then captured by the automated click.
    4.  **Test Script Flaw:** The test script might be attempting to click too quickly without sufficient waits for UI elements to stabilize or for overlays to disappear.
*   **Impact:** Users attempting to add new missions may experience frustration or be unable to complete the action if this UI obstruction occurs consistently. This is a critical functional blocker.

## 6. Recommendations

### For Development Team:

1.  **Investigate UI Overlap:** Review the CSS and layout of the "Add New Mission" button and the avatar component. Ensure proper z-indexing, positioning, and responsive design rules prevent any overlap of interactive elements.
2.  **Examine Dynamic Rendering:** If the avatar appears dynamically, ensure there are no race conditions or unhandled states where it might briefly cover actionable elements before settling or disappearing.
3.  **Cross-Browser/Resolution Testing:** Verify this issue does not manifest on other browsers or at various screen resolutions/zoom levels.

### For QA/Test Automation Team:

1.  **Implement Robust Waits:** Enhance the test script for "Add New Mission" to include explicit waits for the target button to be clickable, and/or waits for the obstructing avatar element to be invisible or not present.
    *   Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "your_button_selector")))`
    *   Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.invisibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "your_avatar_selector")))`
2.  **Scroll to Element:** Add a step to scroll the target element into view before attempting the click to mitigate potential issues where the element is off-screen or partially obscured.
3.  **Screenshot on Failure:** Ensure that automated tests capture screenshots at the point of failure to provide immediate visual context for debugging UI issues. (Though stack trace points to element coordinates, a visual confirms the state).

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Log Defect:** Create a detailed defect ticket for the "Add New Mission" failure, assigning it to the relevant development team with high priority.
2.  **Test Script Refinement:** Update the automated test script for "Add New Mission" to incorporate the recommended robust waiting strategies.
3.  **Re-Test:** Once the development team has implemented a fix and the test script has been updated, re-run the "Add New Mission" test case (and ideally the full suite) to verify the resolution and ensure no regressions.
4.  **Further Investigation:** If the issue persists after initial fixes, consider pairing with the development team to debug the UI rendering in real-time.
